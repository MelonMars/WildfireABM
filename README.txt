This is a simulation of wildfire spread using python and the MESA library. A lot of the variables will seem obtuse, but they should be explained in the code. 

This is almost all based on the paper: A cellular automata model for forest fire spread prediction: The case of the wildfire that swept through Spetses Island in 1990
which is also j.amc.2008.06.046

The linked vid is an example of it working.
